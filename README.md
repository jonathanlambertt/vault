# Vault - A mobile password manager

Vault is a mobile app for storing and managing passwords on your phone.

## My Role

Developer · Designer

## Why I Built This

I built Vault after noticing that my mom frequently lost passwords, reset accounts
multiple times, and relied on writing them down as a workaround. I also needed a
more reliable way to store and manage my own passwords, so I built Vault for both
of us.

## What I Focused On

I wanted saving and viewing passwords to be quick and easy. To save a password,
you only need to provide a description and the password. The home screen displays
all saved passwords, and tapping “Show password” under a description reveals the
password.

## What the App Supports

- Save passwords with descriptions
- Edit passwords and descriptions
- Delete passwords

## Reflections & Improvements

After using Vault for a while, it became clear that the overall experience could
be improved. Through research, I identified three insights to test in order to
improve the app.

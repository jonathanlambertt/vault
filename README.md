# Vault - A mobile password manager

Vault is a mobile app for storing and managing passwords.

## My Role

Developer & Designer

## Why I Built This

I built Vault after noticing that my mom frequently lost passwords, reset accounts
multiple times, and relied on writing them down as a workaround. I also needed a
more reliable way to store and manage my own passwords, so I built Vault for both
of us.

## What I Focused On

I wanted saving and viewing passwords to be quick and easy. To save a password,
you only need to provide a description and the password. The home screen displays
all saved passwords, and tapping “Show password” under a description reveals the
password.

## What the App Supports

- Save passwords with descriptions
- Edit passwords and descriptions
- Delete passwords

## Reflections & Improvements

I’ve learned a lot since starting this project. By examining my mom’s and my own usage, 
talking with my mom, and reflecting on my own pain points, I identified three improvements 
I’m currently working on.

### 1. Supporting additional account information beyond passwords

### 2. Make it easier for users to quickly find and view saved passwords

### 3. Improving support for logging in and referencing account information
